Email spam detection using Naive Bayes classifier for ML model
This project gives an accuracy of 92.6% using Naive Bayes classifier. Naive Bayes is a good classifier for text classification. The dataset used is the enron dataset that
can be downloaded for free from https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~enron/. Instead of using scikit library, i coded the Naive Bayes classifier from scratch and implemented the 
mathematical formula by using posteriors and priors and likelihoods.
